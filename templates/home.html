      Welcome to Harton Play Tennis! As a historic tennis club steeped in history, we are passionate about helping players of all levels
      find courts, connect with others, and enjoy the game. Whether youâ€™re just starting
      out or a seasoned competitor, we make booking and playing simple.
      Having produced numerous top 300 players in the world over the past century, we know our club can set you on the path to success.
      Our club is also a place to have fun with friends and provides ample opportunities to players of all levels to make new ones.
      With the development of our indoor courts, we truly are a tennis club which operates for the whole year and not just the summer
      season.
      Whilst the weather allows, you can choose whether to perfect your game on our outdoor hard courts or put your
      sliding skills to the test on the red clay. There really is something for everyone!
