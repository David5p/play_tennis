# Overview

The Play Tennis website is a responsive applications which functions seemlessly on small screens as on your desktop. The website allows users to book from a range of different tennis courts. The website is for tennis players of all levels and uses the Bootstrap front end framework and the Django web application framework.

# Agile Methodology

I used the Agile methodology focussing on planning the project in iterative cycles and placing the different user stories under different epic headings.

The planning of the project was a fluid process as my user stories, which contained acceptance criteria and tasks, scope was initially too big and they needed to be broken down into smaller user stories.

The MoSCoW Method of Prioritisation was also used. This proved to be a vital tool in priritising the importance of each user story because dividing them up into "Must Have's", "Should Have's", "Could Have's" and "Won't Have's". This provided a clear direction with a large focus on ensuring the "Must Have's" were achieved and the "Won't Have's" providing ideas on the development of the website in the future but not to be achieved at this stage. In other words the user stories were written to achieve the Minimum Viable Product(MVP).

Each user story was also placed under an Epic title of one of Admin Management, Booking System, Security and Validation, Court Management, User Authentication and Profiles or User Interface and Experience. This helped organize the tasks and ensured alignment with objectives.
